### What we will talk about here later: 

1. Alerting on abnormal events and then using splunk alert triggers to execute a python script that will write a specific tag value to safe shutdown the process... or whatever that tag will do for you.
2. Creating a visual dashboard to determine processor states \(run, program, or remote\). The reason for this is because if you are sending this data to say an IT SOC they might be able to enrich this data with work order data to determine if a processor is being worked on. If it is not light it up red and this will provide oversight. This is an example on how a business process could \(key word could\) have helped thwart  TRISIS because processors would not have been left in program mode on a Friday at 7pm
3. This would be a location for large electrical data providing executives the easy ability to conduct analysis IOT make real-time decisions on how to manage their business. Instead of it wasting away in a historian that no one making effective use of it, send it to splunk and make it much easier to use.
