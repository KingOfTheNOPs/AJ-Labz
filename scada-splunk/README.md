## Using Splunk as a SCADA

We could continue forwarding process data to our splunk using  KEPServerNX, but where is the fun in that. We want a sustained solution and just bought Splunk \#outofmoney. So we decided to use Python and stream data directly into splunk. 

Splunk has the ability to trigger external events and for purposes that will be a python script. It is can be an API call to something designed to write to a tag like an OPC server... KEPServerNX... Again have you seen my security budget? Actually, didn't buy get splunk the IT department bought it.
