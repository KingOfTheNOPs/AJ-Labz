### Who we are

We created this book in an effort to share what we have learned as we continue to build, hack, and defend ourselves from ourselves. This is meant to be a book of curated resources that can be used as a one stop shop for people looking to do the same. 

What we setup next is dependent on what we are interested in at they time there is.
