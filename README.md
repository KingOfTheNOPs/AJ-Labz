### Who we are

Jake Coyne and Andrew Gomez

We created this book in an effort to share what we have learned as we continue to build, hack, and defend ourselves from ourselves. This is meant to be a book of curated resources that can be used as a one stop shop for people looking to do the same. It will not be 100% right because usually we are learning everything as we go. 

What we setup next is dependent on what we are interested in at they time there is.
