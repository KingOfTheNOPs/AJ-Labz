# Building the lab

![This will be hard and tiring but you will learn a lot](../../.gitbook/assets/rick_thelab.gif)

### Who we are

We are a couple of friends who have been building a multi-home lab to learn many different aspects of cyber. What we setup next is dependent on what we are interested in at they time. 

We created this book in an effort to share what we have learned as we continue to build, hack, and defend ourselves from ourselves.
